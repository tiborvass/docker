// DEPRECATION NOTICE. PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THIS FILE.
//
// server/server.go is deprecated. We are working on breaking it up into smaller, cleaner
// pieces which will be easier to find and test. This will help make the code less
// redundant and more readable.
//
// Contributors, please don't add anything to server/server.go, unless it has the explicit
// goal of helping the deprecation effort.
//
// Maintainers, please refuse patches which add code to server/server.go.
//
// Instead try the following files:
// * For code related to local image management, try graph/
// * For code related to image downloading, uploading, remote search etc, try registry/
// * For code related to the docker daemon, try daemon/
// * For small utilities which could potentially be useful outside of Docker, try pkg/
// * For miscalleneous "util" functions which are docker-specific, try encapsulating them
//     inside one of the subsystems above. If you really think they should be more widely
//     available, are you sure you can't remove the docker dependencies and move them to
//     pkg? In last resort, you can add them to utils/ (but please try not to).
